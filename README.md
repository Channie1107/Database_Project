VietJet Air Database Management System

This project designs and implements a relational database system to support the operations of VietJet Air, one of Vietnam’s leading low-cost airlines. The database ensures efficient management of flights, passengers, employees, bookings, and services.

📌 Overview
- Purpose: Provide a robust data system for managing flights, customers, employees, and services.
- Approach: Built from user stories (Passengers, Employees, Managers) → designed ERD & relation schema → implemented with SQL (tables, constraints, procedures, functions).
- Tools: SQL Server.

🛠️ Features
- Passengers: Book flights, manage reservations, receive notifications.
- Employees: Manage flight information, passenger data, and service requests.
- Managers: Control flight schedules, aircraft maintenance, and generate business reports.
- Database Entities: Flights, Aircraft, Employees, Passengers, Bookings, Airports, Airways, Services, Maintenance Records.

🔑 Key Deliverables
- ERD & Relation Schema with 9+ main tables.

SQL Scripts:
- Create & populate tables (Flight, Aircraft, Passenger, Booking, Airport, Airway, Service, Maintenance).
- Queries for real-world scenarios (check passenger bookings, list flight info, maintenance history, promotion targeting).
- Stored Procedures & Functions (e.g., flight info lookup, calculate real flight duration).
- Sample Data: Preloaded with realistic records for passengers, flights, bookings, and services.

📊 Example Queries
